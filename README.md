Django is a high-level Python Web framework. In this project, it's used to create the backend service. This service builds the Django application and exposes it on port 8080.

## Setup
​
1. Clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/mariiahorbova/gallery-mate.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd gallery-mate
```

## Accessing the Application
​
* The Django application is accessible at `http://localhost:8000/`

​Remember to replace `localhost` with the relevant IP address if you're not accessing these from the same machine where the services are running.

Please make sure to replace placeholders with your actual values in the `.env` file. Also, these instructions are subject to changes in the project, so always refer to the project's README or other documentation for the most accurate information.
